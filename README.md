# Screener-S-P500-stocks
This is a simple but interesting framework for the screening of the momentum performance of all the 500 stocks based on some indicators(e.g. MFI,RSI, BB bands etc...)
This is useful because it prsents high potential for developing better strategy in the future. This isbased also on concensu of analyst.
This work was inspired by the work of Intrendias on youtube.
I hope this is useful.
